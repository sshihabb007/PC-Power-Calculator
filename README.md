Phase 1: Technical Planning & Architecture1. Data Models & Power LogicComponent Database: I've pre-configured your specific hardware (TDP of 65W for the R7 7700 and ~160W for the RTX 5060 Ti) while allowing for custom overrides.The "Real-World" Factor: Most PCs don't run at 100% TDP. We will use a Load Factor slider (Idle vs. Full Load) to calculate realistic daily consumption.2. UPS Recommendation EngineVA Calculation: Uses the standard formula: $VA = \frac{Watts}{Power Factor}$.Efficiency Headroom: Adds a 25% safety margin to ensure the UPS isn't screaming at full load.Runtime Estimation: Based on standard 12V 7Ah/9Ah battery configurations commonly found in Bangladesh (e.g., Apollo, MaxGreen, or APC units).3. The Bangladesh Tariff Engine (2026 Ready)Progressive Tiers: Implements the multi-slab system (0-75, 76-200, 201-300, etc.) used by DESCO/DPDC/BPDB.The "Global Toggle": A simple state switch that allows you to bypass the complex BD slabs for a flat "Custom Country" rate per kWh.4. Development StandardsNamespace: All logic is encapsulated under the sshihab007 prefix to prevent global scope pollution.Tech Stack: Tailwind CSS (via CDN) for a "Cyberpunk-Tech" UI, and Vanilla JS for zero-dependency speed.
